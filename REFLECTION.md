# Reflection

### What made your assistant “personal” to you? 
Giving the assistant a name and having it handle my weekly tasks made it feel more personal to my life. Another way it felt personal was how it helped me keep track of what I needed to do and told me how I was doing.

### What challenges did you face using this?
The hardest part was making the methods easy to use but still useful for real tasks. Also, trying to fix the coding issues in visual studio took a little longer than expected.

### Which method would you improve or expand?
I would improve the `completeTask()` method so I can pick which task to finish, not just the first one. It would also help to have a way to see all my tasks completed tasks and taks I still need to finish.
